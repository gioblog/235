                <p> <em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way 
                through the earth.
                <br>
                 Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <strong>Pooka</strong> and <strong>Fygar</strong>, 
                who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an <strong>air pump</strong>, 
                which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...] </p>

                This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on 
                Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.
